    p We are accepting article, artwork and photography submissions for our online and our first print edition to be released Spring 2017.

    p For our online edition, <i>Locust Walk</i> follows a structured response model which allows us to capture the dialogue within our Penn community. Feature articles are published the <strong>first Sunday</strong> of each month and weekly blog-style articles responding to the feature content are published <strong>bimonthly</strong>. A separate print publication will be released bi-annually at the beginning of each semester.
