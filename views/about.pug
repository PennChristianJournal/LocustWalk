    h2.strong Statement of Faith

    p We believe in one God,<br>
      | the Father almighty,<br>
      | maker of heaven and earth,<br>
      | of all things visible and invisible.<br>

    p And in one Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
      | the only Son of God,<br>
      | begotten from the Father before all ages,<br>
      |     God from God,
      |     Light from Light,<br>
      |     true God from true God,<br>
      | begotten, not made;
      | of the same essence as the Father.<br>
      | Through him all things were made.<br><br>
      | For us and for our salvation<br>
      |     he came down from heaven;<br>
      |     he became incarnate <br>by the Holy Spirit <br>and the virgin Mary,
      |     and was made human.<br><br>
      |     He was crucified for us <br>under Pontius Pilate;<br>
      |     he suffered and was buried.<br><br>
      |     The third day he rose again, <br>according to the Scriptures.<br>
      |     He ascended to heaven<br>
      |     and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
      |     He will come again with glory<br>
      |     to judge the living and the dead.<br>
      |     His kingdom will never end.<br>

    p And we believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
      | the Lord, the giver of life.<br>
      | He proceeds from the Father and <br>
      | with the Father and the Son<br> is worshiped and glorified.<br>
      | He spoke through the prophets.<br>
      | We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.<br>
      | We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
      | We look forward to the resurrection of the dead,<br>
      | and to life in the world to come.<br> Amen.<br>
